# Social-media-ads
Facebook is not just a social network that connects people with their friends, family and others who work, study and live around them. It also offers other features as well. This project is focused on advertising on Facebook which helps businesses meet new customers and stay in touch.

Facebook users which cuts across various demographics and age groups, various individuals engage with the platform by liking ,pages, commenting on specific posts, reposting etc. Facebook builds a profile of that user based on who they are and what they're interested in. Facebook offers a two-sided media marketplace platform which consist of Facebook users (supply side) and advertisers (demand side).

Advertisers can create Facebook adverts, then create an 'Audience' for that advert or group of adverts. Audiences can be built from a range of attributes including gender, age, location and interests. This specific targetting means advertisers can tailor content appropriately for a specific audience, even if the product being marketed is the same.

In 2019, Facebook's revenue from advertising for quarter 3 was 17.3bn dollars, up from 13bn dollars in quarter 3 of 2018 recording a 28% year over year change. This compares to Google's 33.9bn dollars in quarter 3 of 2019, 824m dollars that twitter advertising made in Q3 2019 and $3.5bn made by Amazon advertising in Q3 2019. These figures indicates how big online advertising platform market is currently.
